# Temperature-Responsive-and-Gesture-Activated-Home-Automation

Temperature Responsible and Gesture Activated Home Automation consists of an Arduino UNO R3, DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor, Servo Motor, MO26 Sound Sensor and 2 LEDs. Depending upon the temperature of the room (as sensed by DHT11), the servo motor (considered to be the fan) is switched ON. Once the room is back to its old state, the fan is switched OFF. Considering the sound sensor, for a clap sound or a loud sound (threshold can be varied), both the LEDs would switch ON. For the second clap or loud sound, the lights tend to be switched OFF.

A detailed description of the code and circuit diagram is attached along side.
